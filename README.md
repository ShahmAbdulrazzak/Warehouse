Software that handles a simple warehouse. The software can load and hold both articles and products from json files. The software can also calculate the quantity of each product that can be created with the current inventory (availabe articles and quantity).

Improvements: 
1. Add graphical user interface (GUI). 
2. Add JUnit tests. 
3. Add price to products to find most profitable products.
